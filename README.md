### google_search_emulation_on_given_sites  
This one emulates generation of a string emerging when one types a request a la "site:example.com object1 | object2 ... objectN into the google, i.e. when one wants to search given words on a needed site  

It includes a counter function. The required gap between two sets of python-automated google search was defined empirically by me as approximately 20 minutes. So, the counter function sets it up.  

Ther is a possibility to choose the search time frame - like "from Aug 21st to Sep 1st"
